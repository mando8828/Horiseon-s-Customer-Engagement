# Horiseon Marketing

## Description


Horiseon marketing is example company using an html site to provide engagement of its services with customers. This site shows how links in the header can be used to navigate to other parts of the webpage quickly through an easily accesible link located at the top of the viewport. I learned how to implement simplified code to create this customer oriented webpage.
